## Key Features

- ðŸ§  **Interact with Environments during Reasoning**: X-Master emulates human researchers by fluidly pivoting between internal reasoning and external tool use.

- ðŸ’» **Code as Interaction Language**: X-Master communicates its intentions and interacts with environmentsâ€”including Python libraries, custom tools, and even self-generated codeâ€”by formulating precise Python code snippets.

- ðŸ”¬ **Scattered-and-Stacked Workflow**: X-Masters enhances problem-solving performance by strategically increasing both the breadth of exploration and the depth of reasoning.

## Examples
- Some response examples for each HLE category are in ```logs/example.jsonl```.
